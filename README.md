This project is a plant identification application. By uploading a plant image, the system uses the 'Plant.id' API to identify the plant in the image and returns the identification results, including the plant's name, identification probability, and similar plant images. The project is built using Tkinter to create a simple graphical interface, where users can click a button to upload an image, and the system automatically displays the identification results. Each identification result also shows similar plant images to help users further confirm the plant species. The results are displayed clearly in the GUI interface.
