# Plant-Identification-System-Based-on-plant.id
This project is a plant identification app. Users upload a plant image, and the system uses the 'Plant.id' API to identify the plant, providing its name, probability, and similar images. Built with Tkinter, the app displays the results in a simple GUI, helping users confirm the plant species with clear information and related images.
